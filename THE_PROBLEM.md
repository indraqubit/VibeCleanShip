# The Problem

## Scenario: You have working vibe code with messy types. You ask AI to refine it. Now nothing compiles.

### Why it happens:

- AI applies "best practices" too aggressively
- Context window misses dependencies
- Type changes cascade through codebase
- Advanced types break simple use cases

**Result: 50+ TypeScript errors, productivity halted.**
